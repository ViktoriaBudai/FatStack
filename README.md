# FatStack
A card game inspired by the Hungarian traditional "Zs√≠r", with a pinch of strategic spice. It combines classic gameplay with new twists for a fun and engaging experience.
It's built entirely from scratch using Unity 2D and designed for WebGL deployment.


Features

- Solo-developed in Unity 2D
- A rule remix: There is no King in the deck. The Queen is the new trump, Ace and 10 score big (10 points each)
- Custom-designed vector card art
- Unique visual style with cartoon-inspired designs
- Light strategic elements layered into familiar mechanics (currently in development)
- Smooth card animations using LeanTween (Unity Asset Store)
- Playable in browser via WebGL build (comming soon)

About the Project

This game is a hobby project I started to:
- Explore the WebGL development in Unity
- Learn full pipeline delivery from concept art to deployment
- Reimagine a culturally significant card game I grew up with

I'm currently working on game mechanics, gameplay logic and create UI design, and more. 
More updates coming soon!
